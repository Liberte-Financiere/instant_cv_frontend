feat(magic-analyzer): overhaul UI/UX with detailed analysis page

- **Dashboard**: Added "Analyze with AI" button to sidebar for global access.
- **Analysis Page**: Created new `/analysis` page with:
    - Interactive **Score Gauge** (visual score display).
    - **Section Audits** (Strengths/Improvements/Recommendations for Structure, Experience, Education, Skills).
    - **Job Matching** (Recommended positions with % relevance).
    - **Keyword Detection** (Auto-tagging key skills).
- **API**: Updated Gemini prompt to extract structured "DetailedAnalysis" JSON including section scores and job matches.
- **Store**: Added `lastAnalysis` and `setAnalysisData` to Zustand store to manage analysis state.
- **Fixes**:
    - Resolved `unique key` prop warnings in `ModernSidebar`.
    - Fixed `router` definition error in Dashboard logic.
    - Cleaned up duplicate imports.

This update transforms the simple upload modal into a comprehensive, professional CV review dashboard before allowing import.
